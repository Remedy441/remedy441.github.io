<h2>Position of an Object wih Mirror concepts</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shows an Object Placed on a Chessboard contains Mountains , Mirror around it.</p>
<h3>Movement</h3>
<p>Object Moves on chessboard  regarding the instructions given by the user using keyboard.</p>
<p>At the time of impact, The position of the objectd will get changed.</p>
<p>The distance from the mirror to the object is being calculated in centimeters.</p>
<p>The Distance changes whenever the object moves front or back.</p>
<p>User can observe the distance at the top left corner of the window.</p>
</br>
<h3>Plane Mirror</h3>
<p>Plane Mirror is a mirror with Reflective Surface.</p>
<p>The angle of Reflection equals to the angle of incidence.</p>
<p>A plane mirror makes an image of objects in front of it; these images appear to be behind the plane in which the mirror lies.</p>
<p>The image formed by a plane mirror is always virtual (meaning that the light rays do not actually come from the image).</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of plane mirror is left-right reversal, Ex. Your left hand appears to be right hand</p>
<p>For plane mirrors, the object distance is equal to the image distance,That is the image is the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.</p>

<h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
