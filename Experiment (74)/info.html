     <h3>About the experiment</h3>
     <h3>Process</h3>
     <p>Initially cars are placed at same distance from start line.</p>
     <p>When experiment starts, all cars will start.</p>
     <p>After reaching certain distance, all cars stop( at same time).</p>
     <p>Your task is to select the fastest car.</p>
     <h3>Formulae</h3>
     <p>Condider Speed be S , Distance travelled be D, Time be T.</p>
     <h2> Speed = Distance/Time</h2>
     <p>As time is constant(same), speed is directly proportional to distance travelled.So car which travelled more distance in same time will be the fastest car.</p>
     <p>You can find the values of different car's distance in the display panel.</p>
     <p>Also you can find the timer which displays the time from start of experiment.</p>
     <p>You will be informed whether the selected car is the fastest car or not.</p>
     <h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
