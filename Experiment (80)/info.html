<h2>Electric switch experiment concepts</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shows an electric circuit with a bulb, a battery, a switch and connecting wires.</p>
<h3>Current Flow</h3>
<p>Current flows from +ve terminal of the battery to -ve terminal given that they are connected.</p>
<p>The switch is used to control the connectivity of the circuit.</p>
<p>When the switch is closed, current flows and the bulb glows.</p>
<p>When it is open, no current flows and the bulb does not glow.</p>
<h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
