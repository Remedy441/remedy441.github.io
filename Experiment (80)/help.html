<h2>Electricity through water experiment help</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shows conductivity of water with varying values of salt concentrations.</p>
<h3>Animation control</h3>
<p>The top line has animation controls. There are two states of the experiment.</p>
<h3>The setup stage</h3>
<p>The initial state is setup stage. In this stage, you can see a control window at the right. You have access to one slider.</p>
<li>Salt (moles)&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the concentration of salt in the beaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you setup the experiment, you can enter the animation stage by clicking the start button.</p>
<h3>The animation stage</h3>
<p>In the animation stage, the bulb will glow according to the concentration of salt and charge would flow in the circuit.</p>
</ul>
<p>You can pause and resume the animation by using the pause/play button on the top line.</p>
<h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
