<h3>Light</h3>
<p>Light, an electro magnetic radiation that can be detected by human eye.</p>
<p>The speed of light in a vocuum is a fundamental physical constant i'e 299,792,458 meters per second</p>
<p>light travels in straight lines until reflected or scattered by objects in its path.</p>
<p>When it encounters some forms of matter, light can be reflected, absorbed, or scattered.</p>
<h3>Shadow</h3>
<p>There is a region behind any object where light from the source cannot reach.</p>
<p> This region is what we call the objectâ€™s shadow.</p>
<p>The shape and size of the shadow produced on a screen, and indeed of the shadow region itself, are determined by shape, size, and orientation of the object producing the shadow.</p>
