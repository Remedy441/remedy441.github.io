Fourth variant (FBI)

    The F(Thumb) represents the direction of Force of the conductor
    The B(Forefinger) represents the direction of the Magnetic field
    The I(Centre finger) represents the direction of the Current.

This uses the conventional symbolic parameters of F (for Lorentz force), B (for magnetic flux density) and I (for electric current), and attributing them in that order (FBI) respectively to the thumb, first finger and second finger.
