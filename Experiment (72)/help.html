<body><h2> Area of circle using Grid - Help</h2>
    <h3>About the experiment</h3>
    <p>The experiment shows how to calculate area of circle using grid(Graph Paper)</p>
    <h3>Animation control</h3>
    <p>The top line has animation controls. There are two states of the experiment.</p>
    <h3>The setup stage</h3>
    <p>The initial state is setup stage. In this stage, you can see a control window at the right. You have access to one slider.</p>
    <p>You can control :</p>
    <li>Radius&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the radius of the circle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you setup the experiment, you can enter the animation stage by clicking the start button</p>
    <h3>The animation stage</h3>
    <p>In the animation stage, the circle area will be calculated step wise.First full squares are counted and are shown by green color. Next more than half filled squares are counted and are shown by blue color.Next half filled squares are calculated and are shown by black color. After that, less than half filled squares are show by pink color. Then area is calculated by counting. Finally area using formula is displayed at left bottom end of display to compare results.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>You can pause and resume the animation by using the pause/play nutton on the top line</p>
    <p>You can slow down and speed up the animaion by uing the speed control buttons</p>
