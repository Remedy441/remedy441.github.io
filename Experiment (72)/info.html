    <h3>About the experiment</h3>
    <p>The experiment shows how to calculate area of circle using grid(Graph Paper)</p>
    <h3>Calculation</h3>
    <p>If we draw a circle on grid( graph paper), we can calculate it's area by counting the squares it filled. </p>
    <p>Area of circle will be sum of number of fully filled squares and number of more than half filled squares and half of number of exactly half filled squares. We neglect squares which are les than half filled. </p>
    <p> AREA  =  (FULL) + ( >Half) + (half)/2 </p>
    <h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
