<h2>Human Eye : Info</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The eye is an important organ of our body. It helps us in seeing the beautiful world around us. It is sensitive to light. Humans have 2 eyes. The Eye is a spherical organ having several organs like :
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ciliary Muscles
    </li>
    <li>
      Crystalline Lens
    </li>
    <li>
      Aqueous Humor

    <li>
      Pupil

    </li>
    <li>
      Vitreous Humor
    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>Ciliary Muscles</h3>
<p>
  The ciliary muscle is a ring of smooth muscle in the eye's middle layer (vascular layer) that controls accommodation for viewing objects at varying distances. It changes the shape of the lens within the eye, not the size of the pupil.
</p>
<h3>Crystalline Lens</h3>
<p>
  The lens is a transparent, biconvex structure in the eye that, along with the cornea, helps to refract light to be focused on the retina. The lens, by changing shape, functions to change the focal distance of the eye so that it can focus on objects at various distances, thus allowing a sharp real image of the object of interest to be formed on the retina. This adjustment of the lens is known as accommodation. Accommodation is similar to the focusing of a photographic camera via movement of its lenses. The lens is more flat on its anterior side than on its posterior side. In humans, the refractive power of the lens in its natural environment is approximately 18 dioptres, roughly one-third of the eye's total power.
</p>
<h3>Aqueous Humor</h3>
<p>
  The aqueous humour is a transparent, watery fluid similar to plasma, but containing low protein concentrations. It is secreted from the ciliary epithelium, a structure supporting the lens. It fills both the anterior and the posterior chambers of the eye, and is not to be confused with the vitreous humour, which is located in the space between the lens and the retina, also known as the posterior cavity or vitreous chamber.
</p>
<h3>Pupil</h3>
<p>
  The pupil is a hole located in the centre of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina. It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil.
</p>
<h3>Iris</h3>
<p>
  The iris (plural: irides or irises) is a thin, circular structure in the eye, responsible for controlling the diameter and size of the pupil and thus the amount of light reaching the retina. Eye color is defined by that of the iris. In optical terms, the pupil is the eye's aperture, while the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop.
</p>
<h3>Cornea</h3>
<p>
  The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. The cornea, with the anterior chamber and lens, refracts light, with the cornea accounting for approximately two-thirds of the eye's total optical power.In humans, the refractive power of the cornea is approximately 43 dioptres.While the cornea contributes most of the eye's focusing power, its focus is fixed.
</p>
<h3>Vitreous Humor</h3>
<p>
  The vitreous humour is a transparent, colorless, gelatinous mass that fills the space in the eye between the lens and the retina. It is present at birth. The vitreous body is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eyeball of humans and other vertebrates. It is often referred to as the vitreous humour or simply "the vitreous".
</p>
<h3>Optic Nerve</h3>
<p>
  The optic nerve, also known as cranial nerve II, is a paired nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
</p>
<h3>Retina</h3>
<p>
  The retina is the third and inner coat of the eye which is a light-sensitive layer of tissue. The optics of the eye create an image of the visual world on the retina (through the cornea and lens), which serves much the same function as the film in a camera. Light striking the retina initiates a cascade of chemical and electrical events that ultimately trigger nerve impulses. These are sent to various visual centres of the brain through the fibres of the optic nerve. Neural retina typically refers to three layers of neural cells (photo receptor cells, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells) within the retina
