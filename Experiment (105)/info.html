<h2>Multiple forces â€“ direction and result concepts</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shows a stationary Box constrained by strings on left and right.</p>
<h3>Tension</h3>
<p>The box only moves when the net force in x-direction is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Here the Net force is determined by the tension in the strings on left and right side of box.If the Tension in   the left String is more,than the box will move leftward and if the tension in right string is more,it will more rightwards.</p>
<p>The tension in the left string   is due to  the sum of masses on the left side(pulley and weights) and the tension in the right string is due to the sum of masses on the right of the box(pulley and weights).</p>
<p>The force is calculated by multiplying mass and accelration due to gravity(g)</p>
<h3>The accelration of Box</h3>
<p>As we know,accelration is net force by net mass ,the net force on the box is calculated as net force acting on it in x-direction divided by its mass</p>
<p>After calculating the accelration,we can calculate the time taken by the block</p>
