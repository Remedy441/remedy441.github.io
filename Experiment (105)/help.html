<h2>Multiple forces â€“ direction and result </h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shows a stationary Box constrained by strings on left and right.</p>
<h3>Animation control</h3>
<p>The top line has animation controls. There are two states of the experiment.</p>
<h3>The setup stage</h3>
<p>The initial state is setup stage. In this stage, you can see a control window at the right. You have access six sliders.</p>
<p>You can control the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>weight1&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the mass(in tonnes) of weight1(leftmost weight).</li>
<li>weight2&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the mass(in tonnes) of weight2( 2nd from left )</li>
<li>weight3&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the mass(in tonnes) of weight3( 3rd from left ).</li>
<li>weight4&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the mass(in tonnes) of weight4( third from right )</li>
<li>weight5&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the mass(in tonnes) of weight5( second from right ).</li>
<li>weight6&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the mass(in tonnes) of weight6( first from right ).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition you will also see a digital clock which shows the time during the which the block moves.</p>
<p>after choosing the appropriate masses of weights,press start to see the result</p>
<p>Once you setup the experiment, you can enter the animation stage by clicking the start button</p>
<h3>The animation stage</h3>
<p>In the animation stage, the box will move around obeying the laws of physics.</p>
<p>The right hand panel now shows the values of the six experiment variables during animation.</p>
<ul>
<li>weight1&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;shows the  mass(in tonnes) of weight1(leftmost weight) during aninmation.</li>
<li>weight2&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;shows the mass(in tonnes) of weight2( 2nd from left ) during animation.</li>
<li>weight3&nbsp;:&nbsp;shows the mass(in tonnes) of weight3( 3rd from left ) during animation.</li>
<li>weight4&nbsp;:&nbsp;shows the mass(in tonnes) of weight4( third from right ) during animation</li>
<li>weight5&nbsp;:&nbsp;shows the mass(in tonnes) of weight5( second from right ) during animation.</li>
<li>weight6&nbsp;:&nbsp;shows the  mass(in tonnes) of weight6( first from right ) during animation.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can pause and resume the animation by using the pause/play nutton on the top line</p>
<p>You can slow down and speed up the animaion by using the speed control button.</p>
<p>You can reset the animation by pressing the reset button</p>
